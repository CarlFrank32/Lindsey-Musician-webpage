# Lindsey-Musician-webpage
Project 1 for Bootcamp
Carl Frank

This Project is a website for a professional musician. Users should easily be able to locate information about past performances, sample recordings, booking and contact information.

The top navigation bar allows users to move easily from page to page. I used CSS to style the navbar and the footer of each page consistently.  I also used CSS to position performance photos, create a booking/contact form, and position links to sample media content.

Ideas for future improvement:
1. Rotating carousel of images
2. Links to social media accounts for fans to access easily
3. Additional page with full resume and CV files accessible, links to published performance reviews and awards
4. Additional page with complete repetoire listed in a table
